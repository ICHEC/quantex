# QuantEx

QuantEx is a platform combining modular quantum circuit simulation tools with 
the aim of running efficiently on heterogeneous compute platforms and scaling 
to exploit pre-exascale and exascale compute resources. Modern development 
practices and software design methodologies are used along with hierarchical 
layers of abstraction to encapsulate complexity and enable tools to be easily 
extended and integrated into usersâ€™ circuit simulation workflows. Where possible
existing software components will be integrated and modified as required instead
of rewriting from scratch. The project commenced in January 2020 with a team 
made up of researchers at [ICHEC](https://ichec.ie) and [LRZ](https://lrz.de).

The bulk of the project is funded by [PRACE 6IP](https://prace-ri.eu/) as part 
of WP8 with additional contributions from ICHEC and LRZ.
